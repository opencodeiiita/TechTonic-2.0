# Task Understanding
From this task, I understood that the main goal was to practice writing clean and semantic HTML and to style a section properly using CSS without relying on frameworks or JavaScript. I was expected to add a new section to the existing page, make sure it looks good on both desktop and mobile screens, and follow proper project structure. The explanation part was important to reflect on my learning rather than just focusing on design.

# Implementation Approach
I added a new "Why TechTonic" section to the page. I used the `<section>` tag to wrap the entire block because it represents a meaningful part of the page. Inside it, I used `<header>` for the section title and description, and `<article>` tags for individual content blocks.  
For styling, I chose Flexbox because it made alignment and spacing easier and helped in switching layouts for smaller screens. I used a media query to stack the cards vertically on mobile devices to maintain readability.

# What I Learned
This task helped me understand the importance of semantic HTML and how it improves structure and readability. I also learned how Flexbox works better for layouts and how small CSS changes can make a big difference in responsiveness. I realized that writing clean code is more important than making things look fancy.

# What Is Good About My Solution
I think my solution is good because the HTML structure is clean and easy to understand. The CSS is organized and not overly complicated. The section adjusts well on smaller screens, and the content remains readable on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Difficulties / Improvements
One thing I found slightly difficult was deciding the spacing and alignment for different screen sizes. I had to adjust padding and gaps a few times to make it look balanced. If I had more time, I would improve the typography and experiment with better color contrast.

# Additional Thoughts
While working on this task, I realized how important it is to test designs on mobile view early instead of fixing everything at the end. This task also made me more confident in using semantic tags correctly, and I feel more comfortable structuring HTML pages now.
